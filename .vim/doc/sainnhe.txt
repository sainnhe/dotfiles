INTRODUCTION                                                     *sainnhe-intro*

This is sainnhe's vim user manual, you should not use these vim configs unless
you are sainnhe. But if you want to write your own vim configs and are seeking
for a full featured vim setup with clean code structure, you've come to the
right place.

In this doc, I'll introduce the design and the usage of my vim configs. Hope
this could bring you some inspiration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                        *sainnhe-intro-language*
Why Use Vim Script?~

As you may have already noticed that my configs are written in vim script, not
lua nor vim 9 script.

The biggest reason that I chose to use vim script is that I want to let my
configs support both vim and nvim. But why? Isn't nvim good enough? Well, at
the time I made this decision, nvim was still very unstable, there were a lot
of bugs that broke your dev environment from time to time. You obviously don't
want to see tons of loading errors when you are hurry to fix a bug right? This
kind of things have happened several times to me. When it last happened, I
decided to refactor my vim configs to support both vim and nvim.

By saying nvim was buggy at the time I made this decision, I don't mean that I
think nvim is stable enough for daily development at present. In fact, I still
hold an opinion that nvim is not stable, because of two reasons:

1. I don't belive in lua plugin developers. I've seen many popular lua plugins
suddenly been archived, and authors pushed break changes that breaks your dev
env. I'm not saying that these things don't happen in vim script plugins, but
the problem is the frequency. It looks like lua plugin developers have no
responsibility for the stability and compatibility of the plugins, and they
write plugins just for fun.

2. The development guidelines of vim and nvim are different. For nvim
maintainers, they think new features are prior to stability, while for vim
maintainers, stability is prior to new features.

But I don't want to dismiss nvim outright, it actually has many advantages
over vim, that's why I placed my configs under `.config/nvim` instead of `.vim`
and use nvim first when nvim is available.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  *sainnhe-intro-code-structure*
The Code Structure~

The configs are placed under `.config/nvim`. To also use them in vim, simply
create a symlink like this:

On UNIX-like OSs:
>
    ln -s /path/to/dotfiles/.config/nvim ~/.vim
<
On Windows:
>
    mklink /D C:\Users\username\vimfiles \path\to\dotfiles\.config\nvim
<
Vim will read `vimrc` which sources `init.vim`, and `init.vim` sources some
other config files.

If you opened any of vim script files in `.config/nvim`, you should see many
fold blocks. You can type |za| or |zR| to unfold them. Note that there is a
special file named `envs.vim` which defines some local config variables that
should not be tracked by git. When vim is launched for the first time, a
default `envs.vim` will be generated, and you should modify the content of
`envs.vim` to control vim's behaviors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                   *sainnhe-intro-working-modes*
Working Modes~

There are 3 working modes:

1. `minimal`: No plugins.
2. `light`: Install plugins with no extra dependencies except git.
3. `full`: Full featured development environment.

When vim is launched for the first time, you'll be asked to choose a working
mode. You can switch to another mode at any time when you type `:Mode`
command.

The `:Mode` command will detect for lacking dependencies. In order to ensure
that vim can work properly, please install as many required dependencies as
possible.

The mode information will be stored in `envs.vim` as a global variable named
`g:vim_mode`.

==============================================================================
BASIC SETTINGS                                                   *sainnhe-basic*

If you have looked at `init.vim`, you'll notice that 4 files will be loaded:

1. `envs.vim`
2. `settings.vim`
3. `mappings.vim`
4. `features/index.vim`

The first 3 files defined some basic settings that will be loaded in all 3
working modes. Let's dive into these files one by one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                            *sainnhe-basic-envs*
envs.vim~

As mentioned above, this file defines some variables that shouldn't be tracked
by git, for example the color scheme and the font. In fact, it's added in
`.gitignore`, so you won't need to worry about tracking this file by mistake.

This file will be generated with default content if it doesn't exist, the
related behavior is defined in `custom#utils#generate_default_envs()` and this
function will be called in `init.vim`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                        *sainnhe-basic-settings*
settings.vim~

This file defines some general settings:

- Settings of different environments (e.g. tmux and some GUI clients).
- Some vim setting options based on https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible .
- Status line configuration in minimal and light mode.
- Other tricks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                        *sainnhe-basic-mappings*

==============================================================================
PLUGINS                                                        *sainnhe-plugins*

The plugins will only be loaded in light mode or full mode.

After loading basic settings, a file named `features/index.vim` will be
loaded, which defines a set of plugins. Refer to this file for a full list of
plugins to be installed.

The plugin manager I use is https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug, which is
very easy to use.

Here are some useful commands that can be used for plugin management:

- `:PlugInstall`: Install missing plugins. By default missing plugins will be
  installed automatically. This behavior is controlled by
  `g:vim_plug_auto_install` defined in |sainnhe-basic-envs|.
- `:PlugUpdate [name ...] [#threads]`: Update plugins.
- `:PlugClean[!]`: Clean unlisted plugins (`!` will clean without prompt).
- `:PlugUpgrade`: Upgrade vim-plug itself
- `:PlugStatus`: Check the status of plugins
- `:PlugDiff`: Examine update changes
- `:PlugSnapshot[!] [output path]`: Generate script for restoring the current
  snapshot of the plugins.
- `:Update`: Update vim-plug, plugins, coc extensions and tree-sitter parsers.

Executing `:PlugStatus` or `:PlugDiff` will enter a dashboard window, which
has the following mappings:

- `D`: View update logs
  - `X`: Revert commit
  - `?`: View diff
  - `J/K`: Scroll diff window
  - `C-J/C-K`: Jump to the diff of next/previous commit
  - `<Tab>`: Open repository url in web browser
  - `h`: Open help doc of the plugin under current cursor position
- `S`: View plugin status
  - `R`: Retry to update
  - `U`: Retry to update selected plugins
  - `L`: Load plugins
  - `<Tab>`: Open repository url in web browser
  - `h`: Open help doc of the plugin under current cursor position
- `q`: Close window

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                        *sainnhe-plugins-syntax*
Syntax~

The plugins in this category basically extends built-in vim |syntax| files to
provide better regex based syntax highlighting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                 *sainnhe-plugins-color-schemes*
Color Schemes~

Color scheme is set by a global variable `g:vim_color_scheme` which is defined
in `envs.vim`. There are 3 ways to switch between different color schemes:

- Via shell script. There is a script `scripts/colorscheme.sh` in my dotfiles
  repo https://github.com/sainnhe/dotfiles . it can interactively select color
  schemes and apply it to vim, zsh and tmux. This script requires fzf to be
  installed.
- Call autoload functions. In `autoload/custom/colorscheme.vim`, there are
  some functions that can apply the specified color scheme. For example,
  calling `custom#colorscheme#edge_dark()` will switch to edge dark color
  scheme. You can type `:call custom#colorscheme#` then press `<Tab>` to get a
  completion list that shows all available color schemes. This method can only
  change color schemes temporarily.
- Edit `envs.vim` manually. Change the value of `g:vim_color_scheme` to what
  ever you like. The possible values are the postfix of all available autoload
  functions. For example, `let g:vim_color_scheme = 'edge_dark'` will call
  `custom#colorscheme#edge_dark()` on every vim startup.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                 *sainnhe-plugins-ui-components*
UI Components~

The plugins in this category add some UI components to make vim looks better.
It doesn't need any manual intervention to work well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  *sainnhe-plugins-text-objects*
Text Objects~

The plugins in this category extends built-in |text-objects|. The following
text objects have been added:

- `,`：Function parameter
- `I`：Indents of current level
- `b`: Block
- `c`: Comment (excluding spaces at the start of a line)
- `C`：Comment (including spaces at the start of a line)
- `e`：Current buffer
- `i`：Indents of current level and all next levels
- `l`: Line
- `u`：URL
- `z`：Fold
- `.`: Current Tree-Sitter Node (nvim only)
- `f`: Function (full mode only)
- `o`: Object, for example class/struct/interface (full mode only)
- `g`：Git chunks (full mode only)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                     *sainnhe-plugins-operators*
Operators~

The plugins in this category extends built-in |operator|. The following text
objects have been added:

- `<leader>sa`：Append surround. E.g. `<leader>saiw"`, append `"` to current
  word.
- `<leader>sd`：Delete surround. E.g. `<leader>sda"`, delete `"` surround.
- `<leader>sr`：Replace surround. E.g. `<leader>sra"'`, replace `"` surround
  with `'` surround.
- `<leader>r`： Replace text with content in |registers|. E.g. `<leader>ri"`,
  replace the content inside double quotes with the content in the default
  unnamed register. E.g. `"*<leader>ri"`, replace the content inside double
  quotes with the selection and drop register.

Don't panic when pressing the keyboard, think carefully before pressing. There
are two plugins that can help you get the job done. One is
`junegunn/vim-peekaboo` which can display the register content, and the other
is `liuchengxu/vim-which-key` which can display available key mappings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                               *sainnhe-plugins-git-integration*
Git Integration~

The usage is simple, press `<leader>g` and you'll see all available mappings.

One thing you should remember is that when opening files with conflict markers
and pressing `<leader>gm` to resolve conflicts, 3 windows will be displayed:
>
    |--------|--------|
    |   1    |   2    |
    |--------|--------|
    |        3        |
    |-----------------|
<
Suppose you have the following git revision history:
>
    a     b
    |     |
    \     /
      \ /
       c
<
You are on `a` and is merging `b`, which triggers some conflicts.

The contents in window `1` is the contents in `a`, which represent "local".

The contents in window `2` is the contents in `b`, which represent "remote".

The contents in window `3` is the contents in `c`, which represent "base".

What you need to do is edit text in window `3` and save it. Then use `git add`
to mark resolution and use `git commit` to continue merging.

Note that this merge tool requires the following configuration in your
`~/.gitconfig`:
>
    ```ini
    [merge]
    conflictStyle = diff3
    ```
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                      *sainnhe-plugins-movement*
Movement~

There are three features:

1. |w|, |b| and |e| are based on camel case naming and underline naming.
2. `<pageup>` and `<pagedown>` scrolling is smoother.
3. Press `s<char><char>` or `S<char><char>` to move precisely to matched
locations. Press `s` to jump to next match and press `S` to jump to previous
match.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                        *sainnhe-plugins-search*
Search~

There are two features:

1. |star| and |#| are improved. Now they can be used in visual mode.
2. You don't need to type `:noh` any more. Search highlighting now knows how
to work properly itself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                         *sainnhe-plugins-pairs*
Pairs~

There are two features:

1. |%| can match not only parenthesis and brackets, but also words (e.g.
if/else, try/catch).
2. Pairs are automatically closed, including parenthesis, brackets, html
tags and if/endif when it's possible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                          *sainnhe-plugins-other-basic-features*
Other Basic Features~

These features work out of the box. You won't realize their existence until you
meet a specific situation, then you'll find that this feature has already been
supported.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                         *sainnhe-plugins-functional-components*
Functional Components~

Most of them appear when you press `<leader>` key, but there are some features
that use other operations:

- Press `.` to repeat previous operation.
- Press ` to add multiple cursors. Support both normal mode and visual mode.
- Configure vim as PAGER in shell:
  `export PAGER="vim --cmd 'let g:vim_pager = 1' -c PAGER -"``
